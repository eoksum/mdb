# mdb
Minecraft Functions Debugger *(mdb)*

A tool which is for debugging Minecraft datapack functions in Minecraft: Java Edition.
I've developed this tool because there were no easy way to debug which command is failing in a .mcfunction file. This tool loads MCFUNCTION files and can execute commands one-by-one, letting you know which command fails. It is very useful if you're dealing with a function file that has 25000 Minecraft commands in it.
